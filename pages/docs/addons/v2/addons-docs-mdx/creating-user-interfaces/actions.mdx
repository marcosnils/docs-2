## Actions

In a user interface, we usually expose multiple different actions. In the example we looked at earlier there are two actions:

```jsx
<Container>
  <Button action="submit">Submit</Button>
  <Button action="reset">Reset</Button>
</Container>
```

These actions are exposed as buttons, in this case `submit` and `reset`.

When a user clicks a button, we send a request to the UiHook with the action. Then UiHook will then send a response consisting of JSX components. We then render that on the screen.

The default action is `view`. You can access the action from the `payload.action` property.

For a better understanding of how actions work, take a look at the [Counter example](/docs/addons#examples/counter) discussed earlier in the documentation.

You can discover all supported action components in the [component catalog](https://www.notion.so/zeithq/Available-Components-90262f73b6d84f208bdde5c21f296c4a#3a8e6e65bb6e4ebd87f56b9fcca55813).
