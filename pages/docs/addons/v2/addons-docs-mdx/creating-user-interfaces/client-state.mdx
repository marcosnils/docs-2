## Client State

Just like actions, you need to be able to accept multiple different inputs from the user. This might include text boxes, password prompts, select boxes - there are many options available.

This is how we can define a simple input box:

```jsx
<Input name="username" value="my username" />
```

Now the user can enter a value into this input.

When the user clicks on an action, we combine all of these inputs together into an object called `clientState`. For this example, it would look like this:

```json
{
  "username": "my username"
}
```

Inside the UiHook you can access this object via `payload.clientState`.

You can discover all supported input components in the [component catalog](https://www.notion.so/zeithq/Available-Components-90262f73b6d84f208bdde5c21f296c4a#1ba2bd9d26654a89b5a73fb2080a215b).
