## Connect with GitHub

This Addon uses GitHub OAuth support to connect a user to an Addon and receive details about the connected user. You can use the same process for other providers who supports OAuth.

Taking a look at the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/zeit/addons-galary/tree/master/connect-with-github) will help you understand how to build Addons that connect to GitHub using the UiHook.
