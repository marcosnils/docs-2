## Recent Deployments

This Addon displays a list of recent deployments from your ZEIT account or related project.

It fetches deployment data from the ZEIT API using the `zeitClient` utility.

Taking a look at the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/zeit/integrations-gallery/tree/master/recent-deployments) will help you understand how to build Addons that work directly with your ZEIT account.
