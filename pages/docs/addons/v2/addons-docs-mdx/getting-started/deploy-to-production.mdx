## Deploy Into Production

We recommend you create a separate Addon to deploy into production. That way you have two Addons for development and production.

This allows you to maintain a stable version of your Addon whilst still being free to develop new features for it in a safe environment.

Let's deploy our UiHook into production, you can do so with the following command:

<TerminalInput>now --target=production</TerminalInput>

The output from this command will contain the alias URL for your UiHook, you should add this to your Addon.

<Note>You can change the UiHook URI of your Addon anytime you wish.</Note>
