## Deploy Into Production

We recommend you create a separate Integration to deploy into production. That way you have two Integrations for development and production.

This allows you to maintain a stable version of your Integration whilst still being free to develop new features for it in a safe environment.

To deploy your UiHook into production, **all it takes is one command**:

<TerminalInput>now --target=production</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Deploying UiHook to a production environment.</Caption>

The output from this command will contain the alias URL for your UiHook, you should add this to your Integration in the **UI Hook URI** field.

<Note>You can change the UiHook URI of your Integration anytime you wish.</Note>
