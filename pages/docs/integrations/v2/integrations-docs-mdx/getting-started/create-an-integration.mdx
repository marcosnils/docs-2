## Creating an Integration

Now that the UiHook has been created, we can now create the Integration on ZEIT.

To do this, first login to the [ZEIT dashboard](/dashboard) and **click the Integration link in the main navigation**.

Click "Create New" and you will see a form like the one below:

  width={1670/2}
  height={1046/2}
/>

Start entering details and at the end of the form, you'll find two fields named as:

- **Redirect URI**
- **UI Hook URI**

Keep the Redirect URI left blank and add <http://localhost:5005> to the UI Hook URI field.

By doing this, you are setting the local endpoint of the UiHook to make development easier.

### Public Integration URL

Once you create your app, it will be listed in the "My Apps" section. If you visit this section and click on your Integration, you will find its public URL.

The format of the public URL is as follows:

<Code>https://zeit.co/integration/:slug</Code>

The public URL is what you should provide to your customers in order for them to access, install and use your Integration.
