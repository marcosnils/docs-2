## Testing the Integration

Now you know how to create, develop and install an Integration, it's time to look at how you should test it.

Testing the Integration is simple. With your Integration running locally on port 5005 [using `now dev`](/docs/v2/development/basics), navigate to the [Integrations dashboard](/dashboard/integrations/) and select your Integration from the list of those installed.

You should now see your Integration working exactly as it would do if deployed, **nothing else is required!**

This method of testing applies for **any Integration you create**, by simply using the localhost as the **UI Hook URI**, you can test any Integration in an accurate setting.
