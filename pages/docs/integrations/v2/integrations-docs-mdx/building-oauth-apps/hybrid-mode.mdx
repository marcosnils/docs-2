## Hybrid Mode

Sometimes, your Integration will use a [UiHook](/docs/integrations#introduction/what-is-a-uihook) but also need to access the ZEIT API in a background worker.

In this situation you **cannot use the UiHook's token** since it is only valid for the execution period of the UiHook.

That's where Hybrid Mode comes in handy. Hybrid Mode is a combination of both UiHooks and OAuth. This is how it works:

- When you create your Integration, you can add both the **Redirect URL** and **UI Hook URL**
- You will receive a **public URL** for your Integration in the following format:

<Code>https://zeit.co/integration/:slug</Code>

- When the Integration installs, the OAuth authorization process is started
- The user is then sent to the **Redirect URL**

The **Redirect URL** supports the following query parameters:

- `teamId` - The `teamId` of the installation
- `code` - OAuth authorization code (you can [exchange](https://zeit.co/docs/api#endpoints/oauth2/exchanging-code-for-an-access-token) an `accessToken` using this)
- `next` - The installation URL of your Integration in the ZEIT dashboard.

<Note>
  You can redirect the user to the <InlineCode>next</InlineCode> URL after
  obtaining the <InlineCode>accessToken</InlineCode>.
</Note>

Now you can use UiHook's to display reports and receive inputs from the user. You can also use the obtained `accessToken` to access the ZEIT API from anywhere, at anytime.
