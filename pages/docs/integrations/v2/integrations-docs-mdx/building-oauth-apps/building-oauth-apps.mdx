# Building OAuth Apps

The main purpose of ZEIT Integrations is to introduce new capabilities inside of users dashboards on ZEIT. This capability is expanded by UiHooks.

However, you may need to integrate ZEIT with your own application. You might also need implement Single-Sign-On with ZEIT.

## OAuth2

Every ZEIT Integration is a full-fledged OAuth2 app. When you create an add-on, or after doing so, you have an option to add a OAuth redirect URL.

Inside your Integration, you can access OAuth2 credentials (`clientId` and `clientSecret`). You can use this information to connect your app with ZEIT.

[See our API Reference Documentation](https://zeit.co/docs/api#endpoints/oauth2) for more about OAuth2 support.
