## How to Use an Integration

- Once you create an Integration, you will get a public URL for it such as <https://zeit.co/integration/my-integration>
- Any ZEIT user can visit that URL and install it on a user or team account
- Once installed, the Integration gets a set of pages inside <https://zeit.co>
- When the user accesses the installation page we call the Integration's UiHook
- UiHooks are only active while the user is viewing the installation (through a short lived token)
- Integrations can use the OAuth authorization flow to get a long lived token as well

Let's build our first ZEIT Integration.
