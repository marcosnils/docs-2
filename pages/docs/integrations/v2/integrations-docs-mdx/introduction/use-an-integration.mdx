## How to Use an Integration

Once you create an Integration, you will receive a public URL for it with the following format:

<Code>https://zeit.co/integration/my-integration</Code>

Any ZEIT user can visit that URL and install the Integration to either their user or team account.

Once installed, the Integration receives a set of pages that can be found at the public URL.

When the user accesses the public URL, we call the Integration's [UiHook](/docs/integrations#introduction/what-is-a-uihook) and use the response to create the interface.

<Note>
  UiHooks are <P.B>only active while the user is viewing the installation</P.B>{' '}
  through a short lived token - the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/integrations#building-oauth-apps/oauth2">
    OAuth authorization flow
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  can be used to receive a long lived token.
</Note>

Now you know how to use an Integration, let's look at how to build your first ZEIT Integration.
