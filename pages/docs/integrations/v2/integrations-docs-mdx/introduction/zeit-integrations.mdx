## ZEIT Integrations

With ZEIT Integrations, we introduce a way to **extend the capabilities of ZEIT** and to connect with virtually **any platform**. Here's just some the things you can do with ZEIT Integrations:

- Add Login with ZEIT to your app
- Add databases into deployments with just a few clicks
- Add custom UI elements to the [ZEIT website](https://zeit.co)
- Enable complete access to the [ZEIT API](/docs/api)
- Configure third party services such as error tracking and performance monitoring
- Create mashup apps by connecting multiple different services of your choosing
- Access hardware and connect with external devices such Arduino, Philips Hue, etc.

These are **just a few of the possibilities** afforded by ZEIT Integrations, in reality, there is no limit to what you can create.
