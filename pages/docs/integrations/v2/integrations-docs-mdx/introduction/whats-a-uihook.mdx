## What Is a UiHook

A UiHook is the name we use for the HTTP endpoint of an Integration. We use the name **UiHook** because it's similar to a Webhook, but based on user interfaces.

The UiHook gets called when the user accesses the Integration, populating the interface with a [Page component](/docs/integrations#component-catalog/page) along with the required information, [inputs](/docs/integrations#component-catalog/input-components) and [actions](/docs/integrations#component-catalog/action-components).

By [using metadata](/docs/integrations#using-the-metadata-store), UiHook's are completely dynamic, making use of [clientState](/docs/integrations#understanding-uihooks/http-payload) to understand and deliver the correct user interface.
