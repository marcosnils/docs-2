## What Is an Integration

Before your start building your first Integration, let's find out what an Integration is:

- A HTTP endpoint, that receives a [ZEIT API](/docs/api) token, written in any language you like
- An environment that can be run locally or deployed anywhere
- A store that can use project level environment variables and metadata related to the installation
- A function that returns a `JSX` string as the HTTP response to build UI elements
- An interactive UI that allows for users inputs and actions
- A platform for authentication with OAuth2

As you can see, ZEIT Integrations are incredibly powerful and offer you the opportunity to **dramatically simplify the process of using your product for your customers**.
