## Tokens

Every request to a UiHook will receive a token where it can talk to the ZEIT API for the related account.

This is a short-lived token. Therefore, you should only use it inside a the UiHook. You **should not use it** inside async task which are executed even after you return the UiHook response.

If you need a long-lived token, you can ask for a [OAuth2 token](https://www.notion.so/zeithq/Building-OAuth-Apps-2ff4b3638269466e87e2b1c68337eeb1).

You can access this property inside `payload.token`.

When you use the `@zeit/integration-utils` utility, you do not need to extract this token manually. You will receive an instance called `zeitClient` which is initialized with the above token and account information. You can use that to consume the ZEIT token.

This is how you can get that instance:

```js
const { withUiHook } = require('@zeit/integration-utils')

module.exports = withUiHook(({ payload, zeitClient }) => {
  // Do something with the zeitClient and payload
  return `<Page>and return some JSX.</Page>`
})
```

You can inspect the [API and methods of `zeitClient`](https://github.com/zeit/integration-utils/blob/master/src/zeit-client.ts) to understand its capabilities.
