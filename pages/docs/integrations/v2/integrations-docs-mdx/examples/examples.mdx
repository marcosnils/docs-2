# Examples

With the previous [getting started](/docs/integrations/#getting-started) section, you should now have a clear idea of how to create a simple Integration. In this section, let's look at a few more examples and see what more you can do with the ZEIT Integrations API.

All of these examples contain a README showing how to run them locally, however most of them follow the below process:

- Create an Integration using the ZEIT dashboard
- Set the UiHook URI to <http://localhost:5005>
- Install the Integration
- Run the Integration's UiHook locally with `now dev -p 5005`
- Access the Integration installation from the ZEIT dashboard
