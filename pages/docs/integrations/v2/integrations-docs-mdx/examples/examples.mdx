# Examples

With the previous [getting started](/docs/integrations/#getting-started) section, you should now have a clearer idea of how to create an Integration. In this section, you will find a few more examples and see what more you can do with the ZEIT Integrations API.

All of these examples contain instructions showing how to run them locally, however most of them follow the following process:

- Create an Integration using the ZEIT dashboard
- Set the UiHook URI to <http://localhost:5005>
- Install the Integration
- Run the Integration's UiHook locally with `now dev -p 5005`
- Access the Integration installation from the ZEIT dashboard
