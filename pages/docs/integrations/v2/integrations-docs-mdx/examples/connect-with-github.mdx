## Connect with GitHub

This Integration uses GitHub OAuth support to connect a user to an Integration and receive details about the connected user. You can use the same process for other providers who supports OAuth.

Taking a look at the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/zeit/integrations-gallery/tree/master/github-connect) will help you understand how to build Integrations that connect to GitHub using the UiHook.
