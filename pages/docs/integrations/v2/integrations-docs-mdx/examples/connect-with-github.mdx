## Connect with GitHub

This Integration uses GitHub OAuth support to connect and receive details about a user. You can use the same process for other providers who suppor OAuth.

Taking a look at the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/zeit/integrations-gallery/tree/master/github-connect) will help you understand how to build Integrations that connect to GitHub and other OAuth providers using the UiHook.
