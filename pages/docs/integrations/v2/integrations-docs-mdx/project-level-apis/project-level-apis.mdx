# Project Level APIs

Deployments made with ZEIT Now are grouped into Projects. This means that each deployment is assigned a name and is grouped into a project with other deployments using that same name.

Users can deploy projects for any type of app. For example, there could be:

- A project for a marketing website.
- A project for a backend API.
- A project for an admin dashboard.
- A project with all three in a monorepo.

Using a ZEIT Integration, you can modify configuration for whole projects, for which we expose a few API endpoints:

## Project-Based Environment Variables

When building a ZEIT Integration, you may want to expose an API secret or a configuration URL for deployments within a project.

For an example, say you want to expose the `MONGO_URL` environment variable; the following would be the process to do so:

- Create a secret to store the value for `MONGO_URL` (This is an account wide operation). For this example, we'll assume the value for the secret key is `mongo_url_for_my_db`.
- Next, add `MONGO_URL=@mongo_url_for_my_db` for the projects where `MONGO_URL` is needed.

<Note>
  The pattern is to create a secret once per account then use it many times with
  different projects.
</Note>

### Utilities inside @zeit/integration-utils

If you are using `@zeit/integration-utils` to create your [UiHook](#getting-started/creating-a-uihook), the following is how to use utilities within your Integration:

```js
const { withUiHook } = require('@zeit/integration-utils')

module.exports = withUiHook(async ({ payload, zeitClient }) => {
  if (payload.action === 'add-env') {
    const mongo_url = 'this is your mongo url'
    const secretName = await zeitClient.ensureSecret('mongo_url', mongo_url)
    await zeitClient.addEnv(payload.projectId, 'MONGO_URL', secretName)

    return `
      <Page>
        Enviornment variable added.
        <Button small action="view">Go Back</Button>
      </Page>
    `
  }

  return `
    <Page>
      <Button action="add-env">Add Env</Button>
    </Page>
  `
})
```

Based on the example above:

- `zeitClient.ensureSecret` will create a unique ZEIT secret based on the hash value of `mongo_url`, then returns the name of secret.
- If the secret already exists, it will not be duplicated for the given value.
- The value of `secretName` will be, for example; `mongo_url_s2kj23jh55`.
- The secret is added to the project (using `payload.projectId`) through the `zeitClient.addEnv` method.

Some considerations when using `zeitClient.addEnv`:

- In order to add a project level environment variable, there should be a `projectId`.
- You can get the projectId from the `payload` object if the user is accessing the Integration installation from within a project.
- Otherwise, if the user is inside a team view, you can hide the `Add Env` button or ask the user to switch to accessing the Integration from within a project.

### Using the API directly

If you are not using `@zeit/integration-utils` utility, you can use the ZEIT API directly. See the following API reference documentation for how to utilize it:

- [Creating and Using Secrets](/docs/api/#endpoints/secrets)
- [Adding a New Environment Variable to a Project](/docs/api/#endpoints/projects/create-project-environment-variables)
