## Step 3: Creating Your Integration

With a UIHook created, you can now create the Integration on ZEIT.

To do this, visit the [Integrations Developer Console](https://zeit.co/dashboard/integrations/console) and **click the Create button**.

<Note>
  Currently, Safari has some issues when working with UIHooks running on{' '}
  <InlineCode>localhost</InlineCode>. We recommend using a different web browser
  for local UIHook development.

Complete the form and at the end you will find two fields named:

- **Redirect URL**
- **UI Hook URL**

For now, you can leave the Redirect URL empty and add <http://localhost:5005> to the **UI Hook URL** field.

### Marketplace URL

Once you create your Integration, you can see it listed on the [Integrations Developer Console](https://zeit.co/dashboard/integrations/console).

Inside your Integration, you can **click the View In Marketplace button** to see it in the marketplace.

Clicking this button will take you the **Public URL** for your Integration. This URL can be shared with anyone who wishes to install and use your Integration.

The Public URL has the following format:

<Code>https://zeit.co/integrations/:slug</Code>
<Caption>An example <P.B>Public URL</P.B> for an Integration.</Caption>
